Portfolio Item Tree
===================

## Overview

Another take on the Portfolio Items page in Rally. This time using a dendogram style visualisation.

This app will allow you to select a type, then an item in your scope with that type and then it will create a tree of the child artifacts.

The artefacts are arranged in columns to effectively show you a story map that can also extend down to the task level if required.

The idea behind this is that you might want to set up a consistent view (via either the hover or via the pop-up) to explore the status graphically without loads of clicks.
